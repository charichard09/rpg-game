Prompt: Build a Sci-Fi Role Playing Game.

Character creation: 
Use class to generate different character types. 
  character types â€” scientist, alien, soldier
  characters should have specific properties - strength, intelligence, agility

  if alien chosen, pass alienDefaultInv to character object creation

//inv idea
const alienDefaultInv = {
  level: "1",
  weapon: {name: "space gun", attribute: +2 strength}
  armor: "space suit",
  coin: "10"
  }




Characters should be able to add, drop, buy and sell items:

class Character {
  ...code above

  dropItem(item) {
    delete this.inventory[item];
  }
  addItem(item) {

    //if Object.keys(this.inventory).length > 10, print some error 
  }
}


Battle system: 
Determine conditions for winning a battle, defeat monsters
//if 2 out of 3 strength, int, agility are bigger than monsters, we win

// some kind players
fight enemy option uses class to create an enemy with random properties and use determine winner function 

// exp system
if the fight is won, increase character level by 1. Multiply a random 1/3 stats by 2.

// loot system
if the fight is won, offer to add or drop a random item from a loot table {lets say 10 items in here}
